# Kotlin JetBrains WebApp

## About this experiment

After hearing so much about [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and [Ktor](https://ktor.io/) I decided to give them a try and start building a sample project with them.
As both of these technologies are from [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/), I also decided to use [Exposed](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed) to have the complete picture.
