# A Webservice in Go

## Why a WebService in Go into the playground ?

Well, I made some code in my work experiences where I used Go Webservices that I instrumented with OpenTelemetry.
In this project, I make an attempt to restart the design from scratch of an OpenTelemetry monitored web-based service to propose a nice architecture to be used as a base for a later application development.
