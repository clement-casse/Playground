# I Hate Latex ...

## ... But it is life and sometime it is unavoidable

I sincerely do not like the LaTeX language, it is a fact that every time I use this language it ends up generating such a massive amount of frustration on me that discourages me from writting !
Still, I have to admit that the quality of LaTeX documents is good and that, in research, when working collaboratively on a document may require to use LaTeX.
Also, in the context of my PhD, I made some publication it LaTeX (it was before Typst has been released), so being able to compile them might still be a good idea.

## The Purpose of `i-hate-latex`

This is the purpose of this experiment : Provide a Nix Flake to being able to work on LaTeX document without having it installed in the `$PATH` the rest of the time.
Nix Flakes offer a pleasant experience for having a deveopment environment and a build system automated and reproducible.
