# Personnal Playground for Testing & Discovering New Technologies

Well, it looks more like a Nix flakes repository at this stage ... and it is almost on purpose, this repository lists some of my experiments trying some tech tools / languages / frameworks.
I tend to use Nix Flakes for my development environments recently and that repository listing my personnal experiments appears to be a good candidate for listing my custom flakes.
As a disclamer, I am still learning Nix so these flakes may not be so pretty, I am doing my best to make them boring so we can focus not on the flake definition but on the content.
